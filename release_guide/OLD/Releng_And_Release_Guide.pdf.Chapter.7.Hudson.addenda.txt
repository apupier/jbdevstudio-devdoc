== 7.1. Jenkins (Hudson) ==

It is important to back up changes to Jenkins scripts in SVN to improve accountability 
and auditability. The most frequently run scripts are here:

	https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/DevStudio/
	
Jenkins config files are cached here: The scripts are stored here:

	https://svn.jboss.org/repos/devstudio/trunk/hudson-jobs/cache/

To configure Jenkins to run these scripts, go to the appropriate page and paste in the correct script.

	https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/DevStudio/job/devstudio-nightly/configure
	https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/DevStudio/job/jbosstools-nightly/configure

== 7.2. VNC Access To In-Progress Builds ==

Should a build get stuck, or should you need to interact with the UI during a build, 
you can VNC to the server as follows.

To access hudson cluster boxes via VNC, connect to the box as follows:

Eg., for 
	conf2-linux, VNC to conf2.qa.atl2.redhat.com
	soa3-RHEL5-x86,  use soa3.qa.atl2.redhat.com

Password is probably something like "jboss42". 

If that is incorrect, find someone in #jbossqa on RH IRC server such as akostadinov or tomben and ask them for the new one.

To connect to the server, you must know the correct VNC server port. Check the Console Output (build.log) for the desktop port number used. 

	Starting xvnc
	[devstudio-nightly] $ vncserver :10
	
	New 'conf2.qa.atl2.redhat.com:10 (hudson)' desktop is conf2.qa.atl2.redhat.com:10
	
	Starting applications specified in /home/hudson/.vnc/xstartup
	Log file is /home/hudson/.vnc/conf2.qa.atl2.redhat.com:10.log

Should you need actual IP addresses, you can look them up here:

	ssh dev01.qa.atl2.redhat.com "cat /qa/tools/opt/etc/assigned-ips | grep conf2"

If you need a vnc client, there are many choices, from tightvnc to vinagre. YMMV.
