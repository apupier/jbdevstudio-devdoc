To push changes, use ssh://git@github.com:nickboldt/freemarker.git - https://github.com/nickboldt/freemarker.git does not seem to work

	Team > Remote > Configure Push to Upstream... 

Then:

	Right-click project > Team > Commit and Push... > 
		or
	Right-click project > Team > Remote > Push... > 
		Source ref: HEAD
		Destination ref: refs/head/trunk
		Click 'All Branches Spec' button > Next > Finish 

		(this could take some time to finish depending on how much has changed)


=== Pulling (Fetching) Changes ===

To pull changes, use ssh://git@github.com:nickboldt/freemarker.git - https://github.com/nickboldt/freemarker.git does not seem to work

	Team > Remote > Configure Fetch from Upstream... > set correct branch (eg., trunk or 4.0.0.Alpha1) 

Then click 'Save' or 'Save and Fetch'

Once configured use this to pull updates:

	Team > Pull


=== Switching between branches ===

To attach your local repo to a remote branch (first time):

	Right-click project > Team > Switch to... > New Branch > "trunk"

Then later, to switch to an existing branch:

	Right-click project > Team > Switch to... > select branch (eg., trunk)

Be sure to pull updates to avoid merge conflicts.
